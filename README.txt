F1 Race Simulator

This is a C++ program that simulates a race between 6 current drivers on the F1 grid.
The drivers are from the 2024 Aston Martin, Mercedes, and McLaren F1 Teams. The 
program will allow you to choose one track from a list of 5 tracks (Silverstone, 
Monza, Spa-Francorchamps, Suzuka, and Monaco). You will then be able to place the
drivers in a starting grid. The progam will then run the race and display the results
along with each driver's fastest lap and average lap times. You will also have the
option to view the time of each lap for each driver.

All of the files to run the program are already included. All you need to do is download
the zip file and unzip it. You will then have to open command prompt and direct it to the
build folder. This can be done by typing cd "/filelocationpath", for example, I typed 
"cd /AERSP424/Project/RaceSim/build". After that, just type "race_simulator.exe" and the
program will start running.

Once the program starts to run, you will need to type a number between 1 and 5 and hit enter
to select the track you want to simulate. Next, you will enter the number associated with 
the driver you want in P1 to start the race and hit enter. Keep repeating this for each
position. The program will ask if you want to see detailed lap times, type in "Y" if you 
want to see detailed lap times and "N" if you do not. The results will then be displayed.

If you enter an incorrect value, the program will prompt you to just type in a correct value.
